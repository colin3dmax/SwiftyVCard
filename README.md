# SwiftyVCard
Parsing and generation of `vCards`, for `Swift` lang

**Warning!**

This is primitive library. It was created to meet the needs of my project, and does not implement the protocol `vCard 4.0` fully. In the future, it will be updated to a full framework that implements the `vCard` standard.
